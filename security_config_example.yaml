# AWS MCP Server Security Configuration Example
# Place this file at a location specified by AWS_MCP_SECURITY_CONFIG environment variable

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üîí Security Rules Overview üîí
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The AWS MCP Server security system uses three layers of protection:
#
# 1. DANGEROUS_COMMANDS: Block specific commands that could compromise security
#    or lead to account takeover, privilege escalation, or audit tampering
#
# 2. SAFE_PATTERNS: Allow read-only and explicitly safe operations that
#    match dangerous patterns but are needed for normal operation
#
# 3. REGEX_RULES: Complex pattern matching for security risks that can't
#    be captured by simple command patterns
#
# How the layers work together:
# - First, the system checks if a command matches any dangerous pattern
# - If it does, the system then checks if it matches any safe pattern
# - If it matches a safe pattern, it's allowed despite being dangerous
# - Finally, the command is checked against all regex rules
# - Any match with a regex rule will block the command, regardless of other checks
#
# Security Mode:
# - Set AWS_MCP_SECURITY_MODE=strict (default) to enforce all rules
# - Set AWS_MCP_SECURITY_MODE=permissive to log warnings but allow execution
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üîë Identity and Access Control Security Rules
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These rules focus on preventing identity-based attacks such as:
# - Account takeover via creation of unauthorized users/credentials
# - Privilege escalation by attaching permissive policies
# - Credential exposure through access key creation
# - Console password creation and MFA device manipulation
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Commands considered dangerous by security category
# Keys are AWS service names, values are lists of command prefixes to block
dangerous_commands:
  # Identity and Access Management - core of security
