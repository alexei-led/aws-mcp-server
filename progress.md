# AWS MCP Server Implementation Progress

## Planning Phase

### Project Analysis (Initial)

- Analyzed the spec.md document to understand requirements
- Identified key components: MCP Interface, Tool Handler, AWS CLI Executor, Output Formatter
- Determined required Python packages
- Outlined the file structure
- Documented key technical decisions

### Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Set up project structure and dependencies (pyproject.toml)
2. ✅ Implement core MCP server with protocol handling
3. ✅ Create AWS CLI execution utilities
4. ✅ Implement describe_command tool
5. ✅ Implement execute_command tool
6. ✅ Add output formatting
7. ✅ Create Dockerfile for containerization
8. ✅ Write tests for all components
9. ✅ Create documentation (README.md)

## Implementation Phase

### Completed Tasks

- Created pyproject.toml with dependencies
- Set up file structure
- Created core server implementation with MCP protocol handling
- Implemented CLI executor utility
- Added output formatting for better readability
- Created describe_command and execute_command tools
- Added Docker and docker-compose configuration
- Created unit tests for all components
- Added integration tests for server

### Technical Decisions

#### Authentication Strategy

- Using host machine's AWS credentials (mounted in Docker)
- Supporting profile selection via environment variables
- Never storing credentials in the application

#### Command Execution

- Using asyncio subprocess for non-blocking execution
- Implementing timeouts to prevent long-running commands
- Validating all commands to ensure they start with "aws"
- Formatting output for better readability

#### Error Handling

- Using specific exception types for different error scenarios
- Providing clear error messages
- Implementing exception handling in the MCP server

#### Deployment Strategy

- Primary: Docker with AWS CLI pre-installed
- Alternative: Direct Python installation

## Updates and Revisions

### MCP SDK Update (First Iteration)
- Updated the implementation to use the official MCP Python SDK (package name: `mcp`)
- Modified the server initialization to use the latest SDK conventions
- Updated tool registration to use ToolDefinition objects
- Changed from `connect` to `serve` method for transports
- Updated tests to work with the new SDK structure

### MCP SDK Update (Second Iteration)
- Completely refactored to use FastMCP high-level API
- Simplified implementation by using decorators for tool registration
- Removed separate tool modules in favor of a single server module
- Streamlined server startup with FastMCP's transport management

### Dependency Management Improvements
- Separated runtime and development dependencies in pyproject.toml
- Created distinct dependency groups: 'test' and 'lint'
- Updated README.md with instructions for installing different dependency groups

### Python 3.13 and Modern Syntax
- Updated code to use Python 3.13 syntax features
- Replaced imported types (List, Dict, etc.) with built-in type annotations (list, dict)
- Used union types with pipe operator (str | None) instead of Optional
- Removed mypy in favor of VS Code + Pylance for static type checking
- Updated ruff configuration for Python 3.13 compatibility

### CI/CD Integration
- Added GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment
- Created separate workflows for CI, development, and release
- Set up Docker image building and publishing to GitHub Container Registry
- Configured automated testing and linting in the CI pipeline
- Added PyPI publishing on release

## Summary

The AWS MCP Server implementation is complete and includes all the features specified in the requirements:

1. Full MCP protocol implementation with initialization workflow using the official SDK
2. Two primary tools: describe_command and execute_command
3. AWS CLI command execution with proper error handling
4. Output formatting for better readability
5. Docker-based deployment
6. Comprehensive test suite

The server can be run either through Docker or directly as a Python application, and supports both stdio and TCP transport options.
